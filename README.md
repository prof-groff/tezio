# Tezio Wallet

An open-source hardware wallet built for the Arduino MKR WIFI 1010 and Nano 33 IoT. To run the wallet the device must first be configured and provisioned using the Tezio_Wallet_Setup.ino sketch. Once the board is configured and provisioned, upload the <code>Tezio_Wallet_API.ino</code> sketch and interact via the API. See the README.md in the arduino folder for more details.
