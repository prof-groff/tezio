## Cryptoprocessors

Using integrated circuits like the Microchip ECC508 and ECC608 cryptoprocessor chips, IoT devices can securely participate in networks using eliptic curve digital signatures algorithms and Diffie Hellman key exchange without exposing private keys. Private keys are stored in hardware and are unhackable. Preliminary development of Tezio software is being done on Arduino Nano 33 IoT and Arduino WiFi 1010 devices, which use the ECC608A and ECC508, respectively.
