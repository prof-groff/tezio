# About 

The Tezio (tez-eye-oh) Project aims to make blockchain, Tezos specifically, accessible for the maker community. Makers are a technology-centric DIY culture enabled by low-cost open technologies that celebrates (but doesn't necessarily emphasize) entrepreneurship, and recognizes the capacity of individuals to create and innovate, and the power of a community of like-minded individuals to facilitate this process. 

Currently, the Tezio Project has three dimensions. 
  - To eductate the community about blockchain technology and Tezos. 
  - To contribute to the Tezos ecosystem by starting a bakery, the Tezos name for a network node that forms and validates new blocks.
  - To develop open software and hardware tools for the Tezos blockchain.

Tezio is the work of Jeff Groff, a professor of physics at Shepherd University in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, United States of America
