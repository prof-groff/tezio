# Project Overview

## Hardware Specifications
* Developed on low-cost open-source hardware
  - Arduino or Arduino compatible, Raspberry Pi
* Edge devices use WiFi, 2.4 Ghz mesh networks (e.g., Zigbee), or LoRa communications to directly interact with cloud resources or with a network-connected coordinator.
* Cryptographic private keys are stored on tamper proof cyrptographic integrated circuits (cryptochips).

## Software Specifications
* Code for edge devices developed using C++.
  - C++ is the most popular programing language for microcontroller-based embedded electronics 
* Code for cloud and collector devices developed using Python

## Goals
* Engineer purpose-built battery-powered hardware that can interface with a variety of enviornmental sensors, connect to wireless networks, and perform cryptographic functions.
* Engineer software libraries to allow this hardware to interact with the Tezos blockchain via RPC calls to a public node.
